    Project Overview 


This project will involve concepts from all core training modules; more
specifically, this will involve:

    Project Management
    Python Fundamentals
    Python Testing
    Git
    Basic Linux
    Python Web Development
    Continuous Integration
    Cloud Fundamentals
    Databases

### Overall Objective​

​

To create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools,​
methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules​
covered during training.

This individual project involved creating an application that would allow users to track e-liquids that they have tried or want to try. 
The system used tools such as MySQL queries, Python/Flask Libraries and a combination of HTML, 
CSS front end and Jinja2 to weave everything together. This app was fully deployed as a service through Jenkins, 
using a web hook to automatically generate builds from commits on GitHub. My application fully utilises CRUD functionality and 
Jenkins to commit to changes to the repository, utilising CI/CD methodologies. 

### Why Eliquids

I have recently quit smoking with the help of a vape and have found that there is such a wide variety of
eliquids available it can be hard to keep track of what ones I have tried and liked and what ones I don't like

### Planning
To plan the project I made a trello board with my users stories and a list of task that need to be done. 
As I have moved through the project I updated the board with task that were in progress and that were finished.
I also created wireframes to try and get an idea of what the web app might look like once it was complete.

included:

    GitHub
    

### Future Develpoment
In the near future I am hoping to add a few more features to the app that will allow users to get suggestions
for new E-Liquids to try based on what they already like and a feature that will let them tack how long there liquids
and coils last them and give notifications to let them know when they will need to buy new ones.
