    <h2>Looking to quit smoking</h2>
    <p>
        E-cigarettes, also known as vapes, are one of the more recent stop smoking aids to become available <br>
        and they can help you quit smoking for good.<br>
        E-cigarettes can help you manage your nicotine craving
    <br>
    Here are some handy links if you are looking to quit smoking with a vape/e-cigarette

    <h2>Coming up</h2>
<p>
    In the near future we are hoping to add the functionality
    to suggest new eliquids to try based on what favours you already like.
    <br>
    We also want to add the ability to enter how long your liquids
    and coils last so you know when you will need to restock.
